# Danish Artist Marketplace

A modern web application for a Danish artist collective selling paintings through an innovative "bid what you want" system with secret price thresholds. Built as a comprehensive DevOps course project demonstrating full-stack development, containerization, CI/CD, and modern deployment practices.

## Project Concept

Three Danish artists have formed a collective and want a unified web sales platform. Their innovative concept: **"Byd hvad du vil og hvis du rammer den hemmelige grÃ¦nse - sÃ¥ ok"** (Bid what you want, and if you hit the secret threshold - then okay).

### How It Works
- Artists upload paintings with a secret minimum price
- Buyers place bids without knowing the threshold
- When a bid meets or exceeds the secret price, the sale is complete
- Real-time bidding creates an engaging, competitive experience

##  User Types

- **Buyers**: Browse artwork, place bids, track auction status
- **Sellers (Artists)**: Upload artwork, set secret thresholds, manage inventory
- **Admins**: Platform oversight, user management, transaction monitoring

##  Key Features

### Real-time Bidding System
- Live bid updates using WebSocket connections
- Per-artwork bidding rooms
- Automatic notifications when thresholds are met
- Rate limiting to prevent spam bidding

### Multi-User Authentication
- Social login via Auth0 (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Role-based access control
- Secure JWT token management
- No password management required

### Secure Payment Processing
- Stripe integration for payment handling
- Marketplace functionality for multi-party transactions
- Test mode for development and demonstration
- Automatic fund distribution to artists

### Image Management
- Secure file upload with validation
- Image optimisation and thumbnail generation
- Cloud storage integration
- Gallery view with responsive design
